# Vibradex

> One dashboard to monitor every app you build — real-time events, alerts and status, all in one place.

## About

Vibradex is a personal **diagnostics & monitoring hub**. Apps connect through the **Vibradex SDK** and stream their events, errors and metrics to one always-on dashboard — so instead of checking every project separately, you see the health of your whole suite at a glance.

It's the backbone of the Vibranic app suite: every app I build reports into Vibradex.

---

## Features

- **Unified event timeline** — see events, errors and warnings over time from every linked app, streamed in via the Vibradex SDK.
- **Per-app alerts** — set alerts on specific apps and get notified the moment one fails.
- **API key management** — generate API keys to connect new apps to Vibradex in seconds.
- **Built-in Pomodoro** — manage your focus and breaks without leaving the dashboard.
- **Polished UX** — light/dark theme, global search across apps & events, responsive layout.

## How it works

1. **Register an app** in Vibradex and generate an API key.
2. **Add the Vibradex SDK** to that app and drop in the key.
3. The app **streams events** (info / warnings / errors) to Vibradex.
4. **Watch them live** on the dashboard and set alerts on the apps that matter.

#   DATABASE_URL=...      (Neon PostgreSQL connection string)
#   SESSION_SECRET=...    (random secret for session signing)
#   ISSUER_URL=...        (OpenID issuer URL)
#   REPL_ID=...           (auth client id)
#   ADMIN_API_KEY=...     (admin access key)

# 4. Database
npm run db:generate   # prisma generate
npm run db:push       # sync schema to the database
